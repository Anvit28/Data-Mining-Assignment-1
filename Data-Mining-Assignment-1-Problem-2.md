competitors is 183.

**PART B**- The singles event where we can see the greatest variability
is in the event Rowing Women’s Coxed fours which has the standard
deviation on 10.9.

**Caption** = We can observe from the above graph that males started
playing earlier than females. Average age for swimmers have gone up,
average age for males is relatively high as compared to females. One
possible reason could be that females were not physically fit at that
time or they were involved in the world war like situation OR we don’t
have enough data on that.
